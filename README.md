# Automated Point of Sale System using NFC

![](demo.gif)

## Purpose

Our goal is to develop an automated point of sale system using near field communications for the Bennington College campus thrift store (TAPA).
We hope that this POS system will help re-establish TAPA by easing the burden of managing inventory and potentially eliminating the expense of employing cashiers.

## High-level architecture

- They can remove items from their cart on the touch screen
- Once they are done they tap their Bennington ID Card to checkout
- The screen will notify that a payment link is sent to the student email
- Now Alex is ready to make their purchase

Administration
- Blake taps the Admin Login button on the touch screen and enters the pin
- Blake can then manage the inventory on the touch screen
